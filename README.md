#### 1. <a id="1"></a> Who is your client?
Our client is Coder Academy’s Operations and Client Services Team. Our direct contact is Samara Jesney.

#### 2. <a id="2"></a>  What is your client’s need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project? <br>
The clients challenge is that the system they use to track, record and analyse student admissions interviews is a Google sheet, which is used by the Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane campuses. 
We will be addressing this by creating an application allowing the interviewer to be able to log responses in real time and make decisions based on the profiles created. Instead of the interviewer interviewing prospective students and then going back to a Google sheet to input responses.  

Some other challenges that Coder Academy has with the current process are: 
- Coder Academy wants to make sure they are accepting students that will be successful in the course. 
- Interviewer must remember interviewee responses and be able to input at a later time. 
- Time is spent writing notes during the interview, and then need to re-entered into the Google sheet. 
- Multiple users using the Google sheet at the same time results in sheet errors and data loss. 
- The current system also makes it difficult to track trends.

#### 3. <a id="3"></a> Describe the client’s current setup and data. <br>
Currently Coder Academy uses a Google sheet which is utilised across all three campuses, Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney. The Google sheet contains the questions asked during the admissions interview. Answers are manually entered after the interview is complete.

#### 4. <a id="4"></a> Describe the project will you be conducting and how your App will address the client’s needs. <br>
We will be creating an interface where Coder Academy staff conducting admissions interviewers can, in real time log interview responses from candidates for reflection at a later time. This app will address the clients needs by saving time with live responses and ratings and resolving the current issues surrounding using a static Google sheet. The main goal of our app is to assist Coder Academy in selecting the best candidates for the course based on real, applicable data and reducing data errors. 

#### 5. <a id="5"></a> Identify and describe the software (including databases) to be used in your App. <br>
#### Front-End:
React <br> 
Reason: It uses JSX which is familiar HTML syntax converted into Javascript. It’s simplicity makes it easy to learn, it’s native approach means that we can use it on different tech interfaces and it’s testability is also appealing. <br>

#### Back-end:
Node & Express<br>
Reason: It’s lightweight, and simple to set up a server in just a few lines of code. It also helps organise our web application with models, views and controllers. <br>

#### Database:
MongoDB & Mongoose <br> 
Reason: It’s data representation is in JSON. It’s high performance, dynamic and flexible with how we can store our data It’s also built for the cloud allowing for scaling and agility. 

#### 6. <a id="6"></a> Identify and describe the network setup you will use in your development.<br>
Our React front-end will interact with our Express backend which in turn communicates with MongoDB via Mongoose. Data will be served via cloud architecture on the internet. 

#### 7. <a id="7"></a> Identify and describe the infrastructure (i.e. hardware) that your App will run on. <br>
Our client has requested that the application runs on an iPad interface (iOS) as this will be the easiest to use when conducting interviews. They would also like the application to be reflected on the web browser. We plan to deploy the backend of the application on Now and the frontend on Netlify.

#### 8. <a id="8"></a> Describe the architecture of your App. <br> 
In the backend we have a server comprised of Node and Express. Our data will be stored on MongoDB Atlas, with Mongoose as a connector. We have a models, controllers and routes folder structure in the backend. In the front end we have our page components and assets (images/css). The frontend will be hosted on Netlify. The backend will be hosted on Now.

#### 9. <a id="9"></a> Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your App.
The high level components are Users, Interviews and Questions. These will be the building block components used for the frontend and backend. 

Users will be staff members who will have access to the application and will be conducting admissions interviews.

Interviews with include the details of the candidate being interviewed.

Questions are the actual questions being asked during the interview.

#### 10. <a id="10"></a> Detail any third party services that your App will use.
- MongoDB Atlas for hosting the database in the cloud.
- Now will be used for deployment of our backend application.
- Netlify will be used for deployment of our frontend application.

#### 11. <a id="11"></a> Identify the database to be used in your app and provide a justification for your choice. <br>
The database to be used is MongoDB. The reason for our choice is it’s data representation is in JSON. It’s high performance, dynamic and flexible with how we can store our data, and it’s also built for the cloud, for scaling and agility (rapid development).

#### 12. <a id="12"></a> Discuss the database relations to be implemented.
We have 3 basic collections: Users, Questions and Interviews. Users and questions will be embedded in the interviews collection. 

#### 13. <a id="13"></a> Provide your database schema design.

#### 16. <a id="16"></a> Describe the way Tasks are being allocated and tracked in your project. <br>
Tasks are being allocated and tracked via Trello. Tasks are made small and achievable, and are colour coded based on progress. There is a further layer of task separation with colour coding based on what is part A, B and C. 

#### 17. <a id="17"></a> Discuss how Agile methodology is being implemented in your App. <br>
Agile development in our app at it’s core comes from our team Trello board. Incremental work is allocated to all team members instead of all at once. 

We plan to continously reassess tasks and how they are allocated and then alter things as required.

#### 18. <a id="18"></a> Provide an overview and description of your Source control process. <br>
We will use git and Github as our repository to handle our source control process. We will have a Github master Tim, and loyal subservients Kon,Calista and Lindsey. <br>
Each feature will have it’s own branch, and once the branch is approved by all team members it will be merged into the master branch. 

#### 19. <a id="19"></a> Provide an overview and description of your Testing process. <br>
- We will all test our own code and the ask a team member to do a code review.
- We will use Postman to test our ie. GET and POST methods in the backend.
- Each component will be tested individually to ensure they work before deployment
- Jest will also be used for Javascript testing

#### 20. <a id="20"></a> Discuss and analyse requirements related to information system security. <br>
This app is available for interviewers and administrators at Coder Academy. The guidelines are that only authenticated interviewers are able to input information and read candidate profiles. Authenticated administrators are able to read candidate profiles and alter questions. Questions can only be altered by administrators who have been authorised. 

The specific guidelines we received from our client in relation to their privacy policy are outlined below in question 22.

#### 21. <a id="21"></a> Discuss methods you will use to protect information and data. <br>
- Authentication/Authorisation (tokens) <br>
So that only users that are authorised can access and use the application.

- SSL certificate & HTTPS hosted <br>
To make sure the website is secure.

- Only hashed passwords are stored in the database <br>
If by chance someone views or is able to access the database they will not have access to passwords and they will remain secure.

#### 22. <a id="22"></a> Research what your legal obligations are in relation to handling user data. <br>
We researched and reviewed the Australian Privacy Principles, and these were the main points:
- Have a privacy policy in place.
- Let users know how their information is being used, especially if it is going to be handled by a third party.
- Put technical security measures in place such as a SSL certificate. 
- Data is viewed on a need to know basis.
- Give users access to their data upon request, and must be authorised.

### <a id="23"></a> Problem
Our client is Coder Academy’s Operations and Client Services Team. When a prospective candidate applies for a course there is an admissions interview where they are scored based on an admissions matrix. The clients challenge is that their current admissions matrix utilises an across campus google sheet to analyse student responses in their admissions interview. This static sheet is while useful, not sufficient in it’s usability. Some of the sore spots for Coder Academy’s current admissions system are the following. 
- Coder Academy is seeking students that will be successful in the course, so the information they retrieve must be accurate and have the accessibility to be analysed. 
- The interviewer must remember interviewee responses for logging at a later time.
- Notes are made during the interview, then are required to be re-entered following into the Google sheet. 
- Multiple users using the Google sheet at the same time result in sheet errors and data loss.

### <a id="24"></a> Solution 
We will be creating an app where Coder Academy interviewers can in real time log interview responses from candidates for reflection at a later time. This app will address the clients needs by saving time with live responses and ratings, resolving issues surrounding using a static Google sheet. The main goal of our app is to assist Coder Academy in selecting the best candidates for the course based on real, applicable data, relieving errors.

### <a id="25"></a> Summary 
The app will be used during the admissions interview on an iPad. The interviewer will log in, and be able to enter new candidate details prior to the start of the interview. When the interview commences, the interviewer will be able to, in real time log responses from the candidate. At the end of the interview, the responses are submitted and an interview summary is displayed.  The answers are scored, and a total is provided to determine whether or not the candidate meets the admissions criteria. The interview data is saved, so the interviewer is able to access the information at a later time. By viewing all, the interviewer can not only view the most recent candidate’s scores, but all other candidates previously interviewed across campuses so the data can be analysed.
